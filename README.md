DoXpy: An Objective Metric for Explainable AI
==========

The goal of this project is to experiment Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning applied to Sentiment Analysis. More details can be found in my Computer Science master thesis: [Deep Reinforcement Learning and sub-problem decomposition using Hierarchical Architectures in partially observable environments](https://amslaurea.unibo.it/16718/). 
For more details about the experiment, please read my master thesis.
  
This project has been tested on Debian 9 and macOS Mojave 10.14 with Python 3.7. The [Scripts/setup.sh](Scripts/setup.sh) script installs the necessary dependencies in a python3.7 virtualenv.

Before running the [Scripts/setup.sh](Scripts/setup.sh) script you have to install: virtualenv, python3-dev, python3-pip and make. 
The [Scripts/run.sh](Scripts/run.sh) script runs all the experiments described in the paper, a few demos to assess the degree of explainability of a Credit Approval System and an Heart Disease Predictor.

This documentation will be updated soon.
